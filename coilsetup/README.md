# Coil Setup

![pattern-unfolded.jpg](../photos/pattern-unfolded.jpg)

This is the coil pattern I designed. The coils are laid out at the circle positions and then connected with tape along the displayed bands.
The lengths of all the bands connecting the coils are all the same. This is by design, to spread the field over the brain.
The size of the pattern should be selected so that the outer coils are just above the ears.
Measure the distance between the ears along the top of the head. Use a measuring tape if available, use a piece of paper and ruler on the paper if not.

Just print one of following pattern templates, matching your size, and cut it out.

Following patterns are made for 3.6cm coil holder diameter and 19mm tape width.
Make sure printer dialogs' page setup is set to landscape.

## Pattern cut-out

![pattern-unfolded.jpg](../photos/pattern-unfolded.jpg)

Read [here the step-by-step procedure](../cutout/README.md) to reach this cut-out with minimum effort.

## Place coils

After cutting out the shape, place the coils on the circles. Here you need to use double-faced tape to help fix the coils.

#### Run tape between coils

![Tape on holder](../photos/tape-1st.jpg)

![Top fully taped](../photos/first-side-fully-taped.jpg)

Make sure the tape does not overflow the paper template, otherwise hair will later stick to the tape.

#### Turn around and tape other side

![Taped backside](../photos/backside-fully-taped.jpg)

#### Put on head

The coils should not touch the ears, as this gets uncomfortable over time.
Have a look into the mirror, walk around a bit and feel if you are comfortable with it.
Because now is the time to change the size if necessary.

#### Turn to front side again, and this step is done!
