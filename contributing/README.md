========

If you have questions you can reach me via e-mail [info@tmsuino.org](mailto:info@tmsuino.org) but please keep in mind that I cannot and will not give medical advice.

I cannot guarantee to answer each and every question. But I will try to keep you informed of major developments.

You are welcome to contribute, especially nicer pictures are dearly hoped for! If you made those, please upload them to a dropbox account, add a LICENSE.txt file (preferably CC0) and send me a link.

As of this moment I have only limited knowledge about suitable distributors, and these are all based in Germany.
So if you got a good deal in your region, let me know.

_Some questions might be of interest for many. I might put my answer in this section, creating a FAQ, while doing my best to keep the asker anonymous by rephrasing the question._

1. Wouldn't it improve the device to change the frequency of coil activation? The Arduino can achieve more here. Wouldn't matching a brain frequency improve the results even further?

**_Hold on_**! Do not experiment wildly with high frequencies. That is dangerous! You can really damage your brain with that!
The typical theories do not apply here. It's all about creating a balance between the two halves of the brain. And this is best achieved with only a **_slight tickle_**.
