Contributing and Questions
========

If you have questions you can reach me via e-mail [info@tmsuino.org](mailto:info@tmsuino.org) but please keep in mind that I cannot and will not give medical advice. I will only answer to those mails that have a **public** key attached, so I can easily encrypt my answer.
I believe this is prudent and in your best interests.

Furthermore putting an e-mail address into the open typically leads to a lot of spam. I believe spammers won't send public keys with their mails, leaving me an easy option to filter that stuff.

Of course, your are encouraged to encrypt your e-mails as well. Here is my [public key](tmsuino-public-key.asc) also available via Enigmail Keyserver (Fingerprint A4BF A8D1 9654 0268 D743 B873 6AE3 7A82 238A B985).

Please note that encrypting an e-mail only encrypts the content. Subject, sender and recipients are still visible to anybody.

I cannot guarantee to answer each and every question. But I will try to keep you informed of major developments.

You are welcome to contribute, especially nicer pictures are dearly hoped for! If you made those, please upload them to a dropbox account, add a LICENSE.txt file (preferably CC0) and send me a link.

As of this moment I have only limited knowledge about suitable distributors, and these are all based in Germany.
So if you got a good deal in your region, let me know.

_Some questions might be of interest for many. I might put my answer in this section, creating a FAQ, while doing my best to keep the asker anonymous by rephrasing the question._

1. Wouldn't it improve the device to change the frequency of coil activation? The Arduino can achieve more here. Wouldn't matching a brain frequency improve the results even further?

**_Hold on_**! Do not experiment wildly with high frequencies. That is dangerous! You can really damage your brain with that!
The typical theories do not apply here. It's all about creating a balance between the two halves of the brain. And this is best achieved with only a **_slight tickle_**.
